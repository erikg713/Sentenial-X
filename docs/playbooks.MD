# Playbooks & Simulators

Sentenial-X uses structured playbooks for automated emulation.

- **Playbook steps**: Each playbook consists of sequential simulation steps.  
- **Simulator modules**: Include `wormgpt_clone`, `blind_spot_tracker`, `synthetic_attack_fuzzer`, and more.

## Example Playbook

| Step | Simulator | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1    | wormgpt_clone | Analyze adversarial AI input |
| 2    | blind_spot_tracker | Scan detection blind spots |
| 3    | synthetic_attack_fuzzer | Launch fuzzing attack simulation |
