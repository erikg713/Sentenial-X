### Sentenial-X Plugins ###

This directory contains plugin modules for extending the capabilities of the Sentenial-X cybersecurity platform.
Plugins are designed to be modular, reusable, and integrate seamlessly with the core API, AI agents, and GUI components.

ðŸš€ Features

Modular plugin architecture
Allows new functionality to be added without changing core code.

Extensible plugin API
All plugins inherit from a BasePlugin class with standard lifecycle hooks:

initialize() â€“ setup resources

execute() â€“ run plugin logic

shutdown() â€“ cleanup resources


Telemetry & Monitoring
Plugins can report events to the TraceAgent or Telemetry system.

Exploit & Threat Simulation
Supports safe testing of exploits, WormGPT emulation, and other AI-driven threat models.

Logging & Error Handling
Integrated with Sentenial-X logging for auditability and debugging.

âš¡ Example Plugin

from libs.plugins.base_plugin import BasePlugin

class ExampleTelemetryPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def initialize(self):
        print("Plugin initialized")

    def execute(self, data):
        print("Processing data:", data)
        return {"status": "success", "processed_data": data}

    def shutdown(self):
        print("Plugin shutting down")


---

ðŸ›  Integration

1. Place your plugin file in libs/plugins/.


2. Import and register the plugin in the system:



from libs.plugins.telemetry_plugin import ExampleTelemetryPlugin

plugin = ExampleTelemetryPlugin()
plugin.initialize()
result = plugin.execute({"sample": "data"})
plugin.shutdown()

3. Plugins automatically integrate with core orchestration and telemetry pipelines.

ðŸ“œ Best Practices

Keep plugins small and focused; one responsibility per plugin.

Use logger from libs/plugins/base_plugin.py for logging.

Validate input data in execute() to prevent runtime errors.

Use proper exception handling and ensure shutdown() always executes.



---

ðŸ”’ Security

Plugins must be sandboxed if running untrusted code.

Always validate input and output to prevent injection or escalation attacks.

Follow secure coding standards for Python (avoid eval, unsafe imports, etc.).
