Sure. Here’s a professional, detailed `README.md` tailored for your `ai_` and `ml_pipeline` modules, assuming `ai_` includes broader AI functionalities and `ml_pipeline` is focused on text classification.

## 📁 AI System - Project Modules

### 🧠 Overview

This repository contains modular components for building, training, and tracking machine learning pipelines—optimized for natural language processing workflows. It includes:

* **`ml_pipeline`**: A clean, pluggable text classification trainer powered by `scikit-learn`, `MLflow`, and `joblib`.
* **`ai_`**: (Optional/Extendable) General AI utilities, potentially for inference, generation, or augmentation.

---

## 🔍 `ml_pipeline` Module

### 📦 Features

* TF-IDF vectorization with n-gram support
* Logistic Regression classifier (can be extended)
* Cross-validation accuracy scoring
* MLflow experiment tracking (parameters + metrics)
* Auto-persistence of model/vectorizer pipeline via `joblib`
* Fully type-hinted and tested with `pytest`

### 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📂 Key Files

* `train_model.py` — main training logic with MLflow integration
* `data_loader.py` — input validation and parsing
* `save_utils.py` — safe model persistence
* `cli.py` — argument parsing for CLI interaction
* `test_pipeline.py` — unit tests

---

### 🚀 Example Usage

```bash
python -m ml_pipeline.train feedback.json \
  --output secure_db/pipeline.pkl \
  --verbose
```

Or use programmatically:

```python
from ml_pipeline.train_model import train_model

model, vectorizer = train_model(
    texts=["great service", "terrible support"],
    labels=["positive", "negative"],
    c=0.5,
    ngram_range=(1, 2)
)
```

## 🔧 `ai_` Module (Optional / Extendable)

> A placeholder or active module intended for general-purpose AI capabilities.

Possible submodules might include:

* `inference.py` — inference utilities for pre-trained models
* `generation.py` — synthetic data generation
* `embedding_utils.py` — sentence transformer support
* `prompting.py` — prompt chaining or few-shot utils

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## 📊 MLflow Integration

MLflow is used to track:

* Hyperparameters (`C`, `ngram_range`, `cv`)
* Cross-validation accuracy
* Model artifact and vectorizer
* Model registration under `SentenialX_Classifier`

Launch MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

---

## 📁 Output Artifacts

* `secure_db/pipeline.pkl` — serialized dict with `model`, `vectorizer`, and `metadata`
* `MLflow run artifacts` — accessible via tracking URI or UI

---

## 🧱 Future Improvements

* Swap in `SGDClassifier` for partial/incremental learning
* Add `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` wrapping
* Extend CLI to support evaluation on a test set
* Optional REST API or Gradio wrapper
