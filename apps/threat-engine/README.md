## Threat Engine Architecture in Sentenial-X

### Overview
The Threat Engine is a pivotal component of the Sentenial-X cyber-defense platform, functioning as a multi-modal machine learning (ML) and rule-based engine dedicated to threat detection, scoring, classification, and triage. It processes real-time telemetry data to identify potential threats, assign confidence scores, and recommend appropriate response playbooks. By integrating adaptive AI capabilities, the engine evolves over time using validated incident data, enabling it to handle evolving cyber threats more effectively. This aligns with Sentenial-X's overarching goal of autonomous, policy-governed defense that combines detection with controlled countermeasures.<grok:render card_id="2ebad2" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### High-Level Architecture and Integration
The Threat Engine is embedded within Sentenial-X's modular architecture, acting as the analytical core that bridges data ingestion and response orchestration. It receives inputs from upstream components and feeds outputs to downstream modules, ensuring a seamless flow for incident response.

#### Data Flow and Integration Points
1. **Input Acquisition**: Encrypted telemetry from endpoint agents (e.g., via TypeScript agents in `libs/lib/agent.ts`) is streamed to the Agent Manager. The API Gateway (built with FastAPI and gRPC for routing, authentication, and observability) then forwards this data to the Threat Engine and the Memory Core (secure vector stores like FAISS, Chroma, or Weaviate with encryption-at-rest).
   
2. **Processing and Analysis**: Within the Threat Engine, multi-modal ML models and rule engines analyze the data. This includes leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4.1 through Python AI modules (e.g., `analyze_threat`) for advanced threat interpretation.

3. **Output and Orchestration**: The engine generates threat scores, classifications, and playbook recommendations. These are passed to the Orchestrator, which applies policy checks (including RBAC and legal approvals) before triggering the Countermeasure Agent for sandboxed actions (e.g., in WASM or containers). Outputs also update the Dashboard (Next.js/React UI with widgets like `threat_panel`, `telemetry_chart`, and `agent_card`) for operator visibility and the Compliance & Legal Shield for immutable logging and reporting (compliant with NIST, ISO, GDPR, HIPAA, and DoD standards).

4. **Feedback Loop**: Post-incident data feeds back into the system, allowing models to adapt via secure pipelines, enhancing future detections.

This architecture ensures resilience, with features like automatic recovery flows and safe defaults (observation and emulation modes only, unless explicitly authorized).<grok:render card_id="c30c7a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### Key Components
The Threat Engine comprises several interconnected elements designed for robust threat handling:

- **Multi-Modal ML Core**: Integrates ML models with signal processing and rule-based systems for comprehensive detection. It supports LLM-assisted triage to classify threats based on telemetry, historical data, and external feeds (e.g., CVEs).

- **Jailbreak/Prompt-Injection Detector**: A safeguards module that sanitizes inputs to LLM components, detecting and mitigating adversarial attempts like prompt injections.

- **Policy Governance Layer**: Ensures all threat assessments and recommendations adhere to predefined policies. This includes checks for operator approval in non-test modes, preventing unsupervised destructive actions.

- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Handles sanitization of raw inbound data (from `data/raw/`) and transformation into processed formats (e.g., tokenized JSONL in `data/processed/`) for efficient ML inference.

- **Logging and Auditing Interface**: Generates cryptographically signed, immutable logs stored in `data/logs/`, facilitating forensic analysis and compliance reporting.<grok:render card_id="737fb9" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### ML Models and Adaptation
The Threat Engine relies on a suite of ML models housed in `sentenialx/models/`, emphasizing adaptability and efficiency:

- **Encoder Module** (`encoder/`): Contains `text_encoder.py` for encoding text-based threat data into embeddings suitable for vector-based retrieval and analysis.

- **LoRA Adapter** (`lora/`): Features `lora_tuner.py` for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, allowing models to quickly adapt to new threat patterns using incident data without full retraining.

- **Distillation Module** (`distill/`): Includes `distill_trainer.py` for creating lightweight, distilled models optimized for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments.

- **Orchestrator Module** (`orchestrator/`): Manages model lifecycle with scripts like `orchestrate.py`, `versioning.py`, and `registry.py`. Supports packaging and deployment, e.g., via the command:
  ```
  python -m sentenialx.models.orchestrator.orchestrate --stage package
  ```
  This produces versioned artifacts in `~/.sentenialx/registry/<component>/<version>/`, complete with `manifest.json` and checksums.

Models are stored in secure external registries (e.g., S3 or GCS) rather than the repository. The engine's adaptive AI continuously updates models through secure pipelines, learning from every incident to improve detection accuracy. Evaluation occurs via `sentenialx/tests/test_llm_accuracy.py` in isolated inference containers using sample datasets.<grok:render card_id="d38f64" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### How It Works: Operational Flow
1. **Ingestion**: Telemetry arrives via agents and is routed through the API Gateway.

2. **Analysis**: The engine applies multi-modal processing—combining rules, signal analysis, and LLMs—to detect anomalies. For instance, it might use GPT-4.1 to analyze threat semantics in natural language.

3. **Scoring and Classification**: Threats are scored based on confidence levels, classified (e.g., malware, phishing), and matched to playbooks.

4. **Recommendation and Trigger**: Outputs recommendations to the Orchestrator, which enforces policies before action execution. Integration with the Pentest Suite allows for controlled emulation to validate detections.

5. **Adaptation and Logging**: Post-processing, data refines models, and all steps are logged immutably.

This flow supports offensive-defensive fusion, where the engine can simulate attacks (via red-team tools) to test and harden defenses, all within sandboxed environments to ensure safety.<grok:render card_id="dfac1a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### Files and Subdirectories
The Threat Engine's implementation is distributed across the repository for modularity:

- **Core Directory** (`sentenialx/`): Houses primary ML and engine code.
  - `src/`: Core logic for threat processing.
  - `models/`: ML artifacts and submodules (as detailed above), including `artifacts/` for generated outputs.
  - `data/`: Datasets for training and evaluation.
  - `docker/`: Container definitions for deployment and testing.
  - `tests/`: Includes unit/integration tests and `test_llm_accuracy.py`.

- **Services Directory** (`services/threat-engine/`): Dedicated service implementation, integrating with other services like `auth/`, `agent-manager/`, and `memory-core/`.

- **Infrastructure Support** (`infra/`): Terraform, Helm charts, and Kubernetes secrets (e.g., for DATABASE_URL) to deploy the engine in production environments.

- **Related Integrations**: Connects to `apps/api-gateway/` (e.g., routers like `proxy.py` for data proxying) and `apps/dashboard/` for visualization.

Development uses Python 3.10+, with CI/CD enforcing linting, testing, and security scans. For local setup, leverage Docker Compose to spin up inference environments.<grok:render card_id="1e47d5" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
