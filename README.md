Deep Semantic Analysis: Parses HTTP headers, query strings, JSON payloads, obfuscated and encoded inputs in real time.

Counter-Jailbreak NLP Model

Adversarial Detection: Fine-tuned layers flag prompt injection, encoding tricks (base64, hex), and warp patterns.

Active Defense: Automatically rewrites, traps, or blocks jailbreak attempts.

Continuous Learning: Adapts to new jailbreak techniques via few-shot learning.

Deep Threat Memory Core

Threat Intelligence Engine: Stores anonymized threat embeddings, enabling fast online model tuning.

Zero-Day Adaptation: Detects novel threats (e.g., malformed API abuse) in near real time.

Custom Model Support: Plug-and-play fine-tuned models for geo/org-specific threats.

Autonomous Legal Shield Module (Premium)

Real-Time Logging: Encrypted, signed audit logs for every event.

Regulatory Compliance: Instant reports for GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and CCPA.

Self-Healing Countermeasure Agent (Premium)

Dynamic Policy Engine: WASM/Python-triggered actions (sandboxing, route isolation, ACL changes, traffic cutoff).

Automated Forensic Response: Logs and rollbacks every defensive action for forensic review.

### Core Capabilities ###

- **Advanced Detection:** Trained on a diverse corpus, including threat syntax, API abuse, prompt injection, LLM jailbreaks, and blackhat tool patterns (WormGPT, DarkBERT, FraudGPT).
- **Deep Semantic Analysis:** Inspects HTTP headers, bodies, query strings, JSON payloads, and encoded/obfuscated data in real time.

### 2. Counter-Jailbreak NLP Model
- **Adversarial Detection:** Fine-tuned layers identify prompt injection, payload obfuscation (base64, hex), and LLM prompt warping.
- **Active Defense:** Rewrites, blocks, or traps jailbreak attempts automatically.
- **Continuous Learning:** Adapts to new jailbreaks with few-shot active learning.

### 3. Deep Threat Memory Core
- **Threat Intelligence Engine:** Stores anonymized threat embeddings and supports rapid online model distillation.
- **Zero-Day Adaptation:** Learns new attack patterns (e.g., malformed APIs) in near real time.
- **Custom Model Integration:** Plug in your own fine-tuned models for region-specific or org-specific intelligence.

### 4. Autonomous Legal Shield Module
- **Real-Time Logging:** All activity is logged with encrypted, signed audit trails.

- **AI-Generated Legal Response:** Instantly draft breach notifications and ransomware disclosures.

### 5. Self-Healing Countermeasure Agent
- **Dynamic Policy Engine:** WASM- or Python-based rules trigger sandboxing, honeypots, route isolation, ACL mutation, or traffic shutdown on threat detection.
- **Automated Response:** All actions logged for forensic analysis and rollback.

### 🧱 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erikg713/Sentenial-X-A.I..git
cd Sentenial-X-A.I.
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Environment Configuration**

Set up your config:

```bash
cp config/example.env config/.env
```

Environment variables include:

* `LOG_LEVEL`
* `MODEL_PATH`
* `ENABLE_SIMULATOR`
* `AUTO_SHUTDOWN_ON_THREAT=true`

---

### 🚀 Running the Core Engine

Start the core semantic threat pipeline:

```bash
python core/engine/semantics_analyzer.py
```

This entry point:

* Parses traffic from `http_parser.py`
* Applies classifiers
* Triggers orchestration via `incident_reflex_manager.py`

---

### 🛡️ Running in Monitor Mode (Passive Detection)

```bash
python sentinel_main.py --mode=passive
```

* No traffic is blocked or sandboxed.
* Threats logged to `logs/threats.json`.

---

### ⚔️ Running in Defense Mode (Active Countermeasures)

```bash
python sentinel_main.py --mode=active
```

* Automatically triggers honeypots, ACLs, or session isolation.
* Writes forensic records to `logs/audit.log`.

---

### 🧪 Simulate Threat Payloads

Use the built-in fuzzer and red team model:

```bash
python core/simulator/synthetic_attack_fuzzer.py --mode=fuzz
```

* Outputs synthetic threat vectors for stress testing.

---

### 🧠 Continuous Learning Loop (Optional)

Enable model refresh via:

```bash
python core/engine/fine_tuner_adapter.py --autotune
```

* Monitors new embeddings from `malicious_embedding_analyzer.py`
* Injects adversarial samples into fine-tuning queue

---
```bash
python cli.py defend       # Turn your terminal into a live threat shield
python cli.py scanfile secrets.txt
python cli.py simulate     # Run sandbox encryption payload
python cli.py watch        # Stream logs from DB in real time
python cli.py shutdown     # Nuke the bot net (soft)
