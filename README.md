Core components (brief)
-----------------------
- API Gateway — Routing, auth, rate-limiting, and observability (FastAPI + gRPC where needed).
- Dashboard — React/Next.js UI for triage, playbooks, and operator workflows.
- Agent Manager — Lightweight endpoint agents for telemetry collection and containment.
- Threat Engine — Multi-modal ML + rule engines for detection and scoring.
- Jailbreak / Prompt-injection detector — Input sanitization and adversarial detection for LLM-assisted modules.
- Memory Core — Vector stores and retrieval (FAISS/Chroma/Weaviate) with encryption-at-rest.
- Countermeasure Agent — Policy-driven action executor in sandboxed runtimes.
- Pentest Suite — Safe, gated emulation for resilience testing.
- Compliance & Legal Shield — Evidence packaging, signed logs, and reporting templates.

Architecture overview
---------------------
1. Agents stream encrypted telemetry to the Agent Manager.
2. API Gateway routes telemetry to the Threat Engine and Memory Core.
3. Threat Engine scores, classifies, and recommends playbooks.
4. Orchestrator triggers policy-checked Countermeasure Agent and updates the Dashboard and Compliance hub.
5. Actions generate signed, immutable logs stored in `data/logs/` for forensics.

Quickstart — Local development (alpha)
--------------------------------------
These instructions are for local development and experimentation only. Do not run offensive/emulation modules on third-party or production systems without explicit written authorization.

Prereqs
- Docker & docker-compose v2+
- Python 3.10+ (for local venvs)
- Node.js 18+ (for dashboard)

1) Clone the repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:erikg713/Sentenial-X.git
cd Sentenial-X
```

2) Copy env template and edit required values
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit required vars: DB_URL, REDIS_URL, VECTOR_DB_URL, OAUTH_CLIENTS, SECRET_KEYS
```

3) Start core infra (local demo)
```bash
# From the repo root (or infra/docker if present)
docker compose up --build -d
```

4) Run the API gateway locally (optional, for iterative dev)
```bash
cd apps/api-gateway
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

5) Start the dashboard (dev)
```bash
cd apps/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
# then open http://localhost:3000
```

6) Run unit tests
```bash
pytest tests/unit -q
```

Notes
- For production-grade deployments, use `infra/terraform` and `infra/helm` to provision cloud-native infrastructure and secrets backends.
- Use container images built by CI for reproducible deployments.

Development workflow
--------------------
- Python services: follow libs/core utils and share `requirements.txt`. Enforce formatting and static typing:
  - black, ruff (lint), mypy
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript. Components live in `apps/dashboard`.
- ML experiments: run in isolated inference containers. Checkpoints/artifacts live in model stores (not in repo).

CI
--
CI pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml) enforces:
1. Formatting & lint
2. Unit tests
3. Container builds
4. Security scan (SAST / dependency checks)

Secrets & keys
--------------
Do NOT store secrets in the repository. Use Vault / SSM / KeyVault or cloud KMS for production. For local dev use env vars in `.env` and never push them.

Security & responsible use
--------------------------
Sentenial X contains modules for emulation and automated responses. These capabilities require governance:

- Policy-first: All active countermeasures must pass policy checks and operator approval unless explicitly authorized (test modes only).
- RBAC: Fine-grained roles for operators, auditors, and developers.
- Audit & Signatures: All actions and logs are cryptographically signed for non-repudiation.
- Legal Review: Offensive or emulation modules are gated and require documented approvals and NDAs where appropriate.
- Sandboxed Execution: Countermeasures execute in WASM or container sandboxes. Active disruption is disabled by default.
- Safe Defaults: Default mode is observe & emulate; destructive actions are opt-in and auditable.

If you plan to run emulation tools or active countermeasures, obtain written authorization and consult legal/operations.

Data & models
-------------
- data/raw/ — inbound feeds (CVE feeds, telemetry). Sanitize before processing.
- data/processed/ — tokenized JSONL for model training and evaluation.
- models/ — checkpoints, adapters (LoRA), and distillation artifacts. Model artifacts should be stored in a secure artifact registry (S3, GCS, or private model store).

Example - run orchestrator packaging
```bash
python -m sentenialx.models.orchestrator.orchestrate --stage package
# artifacts written to ~/.sentenialx/registry/<component>/<version>/...
```

Tests & validation
------------------
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` (use test fixtures and mock agents)
- Model evaluation: `sentenial-x/tests/test_llm_accuracy.py` — run inside an inference container with sample datasets.

Contributing
------------
We welcome maintainers and vetted contributors. Before contributing:
- Read CONTRIBUTING.md (project conventions and commit rules)
- Sign any required NDAs if working with data or model artifacts
- Open issues with ATT&CK-mapped repro steps for new detections
- Include unit tests for new code and architecture impact notes for PRs

Good PR hygiene
- One feature per PR
- Descriptive title and summary
- Include tests and changelog entry if needed
- Mention related issues and design notes

---

## Quickstart — Local Dev (alpha)
> These are minimal dev steps for contributors. Production deployment uses `infra/terraform` + `k8s/helm`.

1. Clone:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourorg/sentenial-x.git
cd sentenial-x

2. Copy env template & edit:



cp .env.example .env
# Edit: DB_URL, REDIS_URL, VECTOR_DB_URL, OAUTH_CLIENTS, SECRET_KEYS

3. Start core infra (Docker Compose demo):



# in repo root or infra/docker
docker compose up --build

4. Run API gateway locally:



cd apps/api-gateway
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

5. Start dashboard:



cd apps/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev

6. Run basic unit tests:



pytest tests/unit


---

Development Workflow

Python services follow libs/core utils and requirements.txt. Use black, ruff, and mypy.

Frontend uses Next.js + TypeScript. Components live in apps/dashboard.

ML experiments & training in sentenial-x/src and checkpoints saved to sentenial-x/models.

CI runs lint → unit tests → container build → security scan.

Pull Requests must include tests and architecture impact assessment.



---

Security & Safety (important)

Sentenial X deals with offensive emulation and autonomous responses. Strict governance is required:

Policy-first: All countermeasures must be approved via a policy engine. No unsupervised destructive actions.

RBAC: Fine-grained roles for operators, auditors, and developers.

Audit & Signatures: All actions and logs are cryptographically signed and stored immutably.

Legal Review: Offensive modules are gated behind legal-shield approvals and operator confirmation in UI.

Sandboxed Execution: Countermeasures run in isolated WASM or container sandboxes.

Safe Defaults: Default mode is observe & emulate — active disruption disabled until explicit authorization.


> Reminder: Use responsibly. Obtain legal authorization before running red-team or emulation on third-party or production systems.




---

CI / CD & Infra

CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml — runs static checks, unit tests, and container builds.

CD: Terraform + Helm for multi-account VPC deployments in cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).

Secrets: Use Vault/SSM/KeyVault; do not store secrets in repo.

Observability: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK stack optional — add via infra/helm.



---

Tests & Validation

Unit tests in tests/unit/

Integration tests in tests/integration/ — include mock agents and simulated attack playback.

Model evaluation: sentenial-x/tests/test_llm_accuracy.py, run inside inference container with sample datasets.



---

Data & Models

data/raw/ — inbound feeds (CVE, telemetry). Sanitize before processing.

data/processed/ — JSONL tokenized datasets for fine-tuning and evaluation.

models/ — checkpoints and adapters (LoRA, distillation). Keep model artifacts in secure storage.

Run it:

python -m sentenialx.models.orchestrator.orchestrate --stage all
# or
python -m sentenialx.models.orchestrator.orchestrate --stage package

This will produce a versioned artifact in ~/.sentenialx/registry/threat_semantics/stable/<version>/... with a manifest.json and checksums.


---

Roadmap & Priorities (Beastmode)

1. Alpha — Core pipeline, API gateway, agent manager, basic threat-engine, dashboard skeleton.


2. Beta — LLM threat triage, jailbreak detector, countermeasure sandbox.


3. Enterprise — Full compliance automation, hardened infra, SOC integrations, managed service.


4. Defense — Certifications, STIGs, DoD/CUI workflows, and hardened offline model runners.


5. Futures — On-device inference for offline agents, hardware trust anchors, VR/AR SOC UI.
