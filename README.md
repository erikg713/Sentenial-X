> **Sentenial X** ‚Äî Built to learn, adapt, and strike back.  
> *Crafted for resilience. Engineered for vengeance. Sentenial X is not just a defense ‚Äî it's a digital sentinel with the mind of a warrior and the reflexes of a machine.*

---

## TL;DR
Sentenial X is a next-generation autonomous cyber-defense platform. It combines multi-modal AI, real-time threat orchestration, offensive emulation for resilience testing, self-healing infrastructure, and automated compliance. This repository contains the full-stack architecture: apps, microservices, ML training, data pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and CI for packaging and deployment.

---

## Why Sentenial X?
- **Autonomous Response:** Detect, analyze, neutralize, and counter ‚Äî faster than an attacker can pivot.  
- **Adaptive AI:** Every incident makes the system smarter; models continually update via secure pipelines.  
- **Offensive & Defensive Fusion:** Controlled red-team emulation to harden systems before attacks occur.  
- **Compliance-first:** Built-in reporting and immutable forensic evidence for NIST / ISO / GDPR / HIPAA / DoD.  
- **Resilience & Self-heal:** Quarantine, reroute, and restore critical services automatically.

## Core Components (brief)
- **API Gateway** ‚Äî centralized orchestration (FastAPI/gRPC). Auth, routing, rate limits, observability.
- **Dashboard** ‚Äî Next.js/React GUI for SOC operators, incident triage, model insights and playbooks.
- **Agent Manager** ‚Äî orchestrates endpoint agents (lightweight telemetry + containment).
- **Threat Engine** ‚Äî multi-modal LLM + signal processing engine for detection & triage.
- **Jailbreak Detector** ‚Äî NLP prompt-injection and adversarial content detector for LLM inputs.
- **Memory Core** ‚Äî vector embeddings, retrieval, and secure model serving (FAISS/Chroma/Weaviate).
- **Countermeasure Agent** ‚Äî executes safe, policy-driven responses (WASM/Python actions).
- **Pentest Suite** ‚Äî red-team automation and simulated APT toolset for resilience testing.
- **Compliance & Legal Shield** ‚Äî automated reporting, evidence packaging, legal templates.

---

## Architecture Overview
1. Agents stream encrypted telemetry to Agent Manager.
2. API Gateway routes signals to Threat Engine and Memory Core.
3. Threat Engine runs ML models + rule engines and assigns confidence & playbook.
4. Orchestrator triggers Countermeasure Agent (policy-controlled), updates Dashboard and Compliance Hub.
5. All actions produce signed logs stored in `data/logs/` for immutable forensics.

---

## Quickstart ‚Äî Local Dev (alpha)
> These are minimal dev steps for contributors. Production deployment uses `infra/terraform` + `k8s/helm`.

1. Clone:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourorg/sentenial-x.git
cd sentenial-x

2. Copy env template & edit:



cp .env.example .env
# Edit: DB_URL, REDIS_URL, VECTOR_DB_URL, OAUTH_CLIENTS, SECRET_KEYS

3. Start core infra (Docker Compose demo):



# in repo root or infra/docker
docker compose up --build

4. Run API gateway locally:



cd apps/api-gateway
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

5. Start dashboard:



cd apps/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev

6. Run basic unit tests:



pytest tests/unit


---

Development Workflow

Python services follow libs/core utils and requirements.txt. Use black, ruff, and mypy.

Frontend uses Next.js + TypeScript. Components live in apps/dashboard.

ML experiments & training in sentenial-x/src and checkpoints saved to sentenial-x/models.

CI runs lint ‚Üí unit tests ‚Üí container build ‚Üí security scan.

Pull Requests must include tests and architecture impact assessment.



---

Security & Safety (important)

Sentenial X deals with offensive emulation and autonomous responses. Strict governance is required:

Policy-first: All countermeasures must be approved via a policy engine. No unsupervised destructive actions.

RBAC: Fine-grained roles for operators, auditors, and developers.

Audit & Signatures: All actions and logs are cryptographically signed and stored immutably.

Legal Review: Offensive modules are gated behind legal-shield approvals and operator confirmation in UI.

Sandboxed Execution: Countermeasures run in isolated WASM or container sandboxes.

Safe Defaults: Default mode is observe & emulate ‚Äî active disruption disabled until explicit authorization.


> Reminder: Use responsibly. Obtain legal authorization before running red-team or emulation on third-party or production systems.




---

CI / CD & Infra

CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml ‚Äî runs static checks, unit tests, and container builds.

CD: Terraform + Helm for multi-account VPC deployments in cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).

Secrets: Use Vault/SSM/KeyVault; do not store secrets in repo.

Observability: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK stack optional ‚Äî add via infra/helm.



---

Tests & Validation

Unit tests in tests/unit/

Integration tests in tests/integration/ ‚Äî include mock agents and simulated attack playback.

Model evaluation: sentenial-x/tests/test_llm_accuracy.py, run inside inference container with sample datasets.



---

Data & Models

data/raw/ ‚Äî inbound feeds (CVE, telemetry). Sanitize before processing.

data/processed/ ‚Äî JSONL tokenized datasets for fine-tuning and evaluation.

models/ ‚Äî checkpoints and adapters (LoRA, distillation). Keep model artifacts in secure storage.



---

Roadmap & Priorities (Beastmode)

1. Alpha ‚Äî Core pipeline, API gateway, agent manager, basic threat-engine, dashboard skeleton.


2. Beta ‚Äî LLM threat triage, jailbreak detector, countermeasure sandbox.


3. Enterprise ‚Äî Full compliance automation, hardened infra, SOC integrations, managed service.


4. Defense ‚Äî Certifications, STIGs, DoD/CUI workflows, and hardened offline model runners.


5. Futures ‚Äî On-device inference for offline agents, hardware trust anchors, VR/AR SOC UI.

This README is a living document ‚Äî when you want I‚Äôll produce the full investor pitch deck (cinematic PPTX), a hardened Terraform blueprint, or scaffold the actual services (FastAPI templates, Next.js dashboard, and a sample countermeasure WASM runner). Which do you want first?

---

Next steps I can do immediately (pick one):
1. Generate a **cinematic PowerPoint** pitch deck (dark theme, diagrams, investor-ready).  
2. Create a **production-grade API Gateway** FastAPI template + Dockerfile and CI pipeline.  
3. Scaffold the **Next.js dashboard** (auth flow + incident timeline UI + Tailwind/Radix).  
4. Produce **security policy docs** for offensive modules (legal approvals + operator flows).  
5. Auto-generate `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md`.

Which one do you want me to build now? Beastmode style. üõ°Ô∏èüî•
