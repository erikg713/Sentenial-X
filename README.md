Project: Sentenial X A.I. — Deep Neural Threat Engine

Core Pillars:

1. Multimodal Threat Semantics Engine

Uses LLM-derived embeddings to understand request intent beyond signatures.

Applies a language model trained on threat syntax, API abuse, prompt injection, LLM jailbreaks, and blackhat tools like WormGPT, DarkBERT, and FraudGPT.

Real-time semantic analysis of:

HTTP headers

POST/GET bodies

Query strings

JSON payloads

Encoded data and obfuscations



2. Counter-Jailbreak NLP Model

Includes a fine-tuned adversarial detection layer trained on:

Prompt injection

Payload obfuscation (base64/hex)

LLM prompt warping


Automatically rewrites, blocks, or traps jailbreak payloads.

Learns on the fly via few-shot active learning from new jailbreaks.


3. Deep Threat Memory Core (LLM Fine-tuner Adapter)

Stores anonymized threat embeddings and triggers online model distillation.

Can "learn" new patterns (zero-days, malformed APIs) in near real-time.

Optional integration with your own fine-tuned private model for:

Multi-language web traffic understanding

Region-specific cyber threat trends

Organization-specific attack behavior



4. Autonomous Legal Shield Module

Real-time logging → encrypted + signed audit trails.

Triggers structured reports:

GDPR Article 33 (Breach Notifications)

CCPA/CPRA audit snapshots

PCI-DSS security incident trails

SOC 2 & HIPAA logs


AI-generated legal statements for breaches or ransomware disclosures.


5. Self-Healing Countermeasure Agent

Embedded policy engine (WASM or Python-based rules).

When a threat exceeds a pre-set tolerance:

Can trigger sandboxing, honeypots, route isolation, ACL mutation, or outbound traffic shutdown.


All actions logged and post-analyzed for rollback or fine-tuning.
