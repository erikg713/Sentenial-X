# Sentenial-X: The Ultimate Cyber Guardian

**Crafted for resilience. Engineered for vengeance.** Sentenial-X is not just a defense—it's a digital sentinel with the mind of a warrior and the reflexes of a machine.

Sentenial-X is an autonomous, modular cyber-defense platform designed for detection, triage, and safe, policy-driven response. It combines multi-modal machine learning (ML), real-time orchestration, and controlled emulation to enhance resilience and accelerate incident response.

## About

Sentenial-X goes beyond passive defense by learning from telemetry and historical incidents, applying policy-controlled countermeasures, and providing immutable evidence for compliance and audits. It aims to detect, analyze, neutralize, and counter threats faster than attackers can pivot, while ensuring adaptability and self-healing capabilities.

The platform blends ML, orchestration, and governance for defensive and testing use cases, with a focus on enterprise security operations centers (SOCs). It supports cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Detection & Response**: Policy-governed triage and actions, including quarantine, rerouting, and automatic recovery.
- **Adaptive AI**: Models improve with validated incident data using techniques like LoRA/QLoRA/Unsloth adapters and distillation.
- **Offensive-Defensive Fusion**: Controlled red-team emulation for resilience testing (e.g., pentest suite and ransomware simulator).
- **Compliance & Auditing**: Immutable, signed logs and reports compliant with NIST, ISO, GDPR, HIPAA, and DoD standards.
- **Resilience & Self-Healing**: Sandboxed execution (WASM/containers) for safe countermeasures.
- **Modular Components**:
  - **Cortex**: Natural language processing for threat analysis.
  - **Orchestrator**: AI-driven detection and response management.
  - **Simulator**: Attack scenario emulation for validation.
  - **Engine**: File protection, process monitoring, and network security.
  - **Dashboard**: Intuitive GUI for threats, compliance, and telemetry.

```

1. **Agents** stream encrypted telemetry to the Agent Manager.
2. **API Gateway** routes data to Cortex (NLP) and Threat Engine.
3. **Threat Engine** fuses multi-modal data, scores threats using adaptive models (LoRA/QLoRA/Unsloth-tuned).
4. **Orchestrator** triggers policy-checked Countermeasure Agent.
5. Actions log immutably; feedback loops update models via artifact registry.

## Core Components

### Threat Engine Architecture
#### Overview
The Threat Engine is a multi-modal ML and rule-based system for detection, scoring, and triage. It processes telemetry, assigns scores, and recommends playbooks, evolving via incident data.

#### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Telemetry via API Gateway to Agent Manager.
2. **Analysis**: ML models (e.g., GPT-4.1 in `analyze_threat`) + rules; integrates Cortex for NLP.
3. **Output**: Scores to Orchestrator; updates Dashboard.
4. **Adaptation**: Feedback refines models in `models/artifacts/` (encoder, LoRA).

#### Key Elements
- **ML Core**: Multi-modal LLM + signal processing.
- **Jailbreak Detector**: Input sanitization.
- **Models**: From registry (e.g., `text_encoder_v1.pt`).

Files: `services/threat-engine/`; tests in `tests/`.

### Countermeasure Agent Architecture
#### Overview
Policy-driven executor for responses like quarantine, in sandboxed runtimes.

#### Data Flow
1. **Trigger**: Orchestrator post-Threat Engine.
2. **Execution**: Sandboxed (WASM/containers); playbook interpretation.
3. **Output**: Signed logs in `data/logs/`; feedback to AI.

#### Key Elements
- **Policy Engine**: RBAC + approvals.
- **Sandbox Executor**: Python/WASM actions.
- **Feedback**: Updates models via registry.

Files: `services/countermeasure-agent/`; integrates Pentest Suite for emulation.

### Pentest Suite Features
Sandboxed red-team tools for resilience testing.
- **Automation**: Simulate APTs/ransomware in isolation.
- **Integration**: With Threat Engine for validation; gated by policies.
- **Feedback**: Outcomes refine models.
Files: `apps/pentest-suite/`; safe defaults (emulate-only).

### Cortex: NLP Threat Intelligence
High-performance NLP for log classification.
- **Features**: Real-time Kafka/WebSocket streaming, REST API, GUI.
- **Integration**: Routes via API Gateway; models from artifact registry.
- **Code**: `services/cortex/` (cli.py, server.py); trains on `data/processed/`.
Example: `curl -X POST /cortex/predict -d '{"text":"Suspicious login"}'`.

### Model Adaptation: LoRA, QLoRA, and Unsloth
Efficient tuning for adaptation.
- **LoRA**: Low-rank adapters in `models/lora/`; rank=8-64.
- **QLoRA**: 4-bit quant for memory savings; via bitsandbytes.
- **Unsloth**: 2x faster QLoRA with Triton kernels; pre-quant models.
Workflow: Data → Orchestrator tune (`--component unsloth_qlora`) → Register in `artifacts/` → Load/verify in services.
