*"Crafted for resilience. Engineered for vengeance. Sentenial X is not just a defense — it's a digital sentinel with the mind of a warrior and the reflexes of a machine."*

---

### Overview ###

Sentenial X A.I. is an advanced cyber defense platform engineered for modern threat landscapes. Designed to continuously learn,adapt,and respond in real time, it safeguards your digital infrastructure with state-of-the-art AI,robust compliance, automation and proactive countermeasures.

---

### Goals ###

The main goals of Sentenial-X-A.I include:

Automated security auditing
Compliance testing (e.g. ISO27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
Vulnerability detection
The software (also) assists with:

•Configuration and asset management
•Software patch management
•System hardening
•Penetration testing (privilege escalation)
•Intrusion detection

### Audience ###

Typical users of the software:
•System administrators
•Auditors
•Security officers
•Penetration testers
•Security professionals

### Core Capabilities ###

### 1. Multi-modal Threat Semantics Engine
- **Contextual Understanding:** Leverages LLM-derived embeddings to analyze request intent beyond basic signatures.
- **Advanced Detection:** Trained on a diverse corpus, including threat syntax, API abuse, prompt injection, LLM jailbreaks, and blackhat tool patterns (WormGPT, DarkBERT, FraudGPT).
- **Deep Semantic Analysis:** Inspects HTTP headers, bodies, query strings, JSON payloads, and encoded/obfuscated data in real time.

### 2. Counter-Jailbreak NLP Model
- **Adversarial Detection:** Fine-tuned layers identify prompt injection, payload obfuscation (base64, hex), and LLM prompt warping.
- **Active Defense:** Rewrites, blocks, or traps jailbreak attempts automatically.
- **Continuous Learning:** Adapts to new jailbreaks with few-shot active learning.

### 3. Deep Threat Memory Core
- **Threat Intelligence Engine:** Stores anonymized threat embeddings and supports rapid online model distillation.
- **Zero-Day Adaptation:** Learns new attack patterns (e.g., malformed APIs) in near real time.
- **Custom Model Integration:** Plug in your own fine-tuned models for region-specific or org-specific intelligence.

### 4. Autonomous Legal Shield Module
- **Real-Time Logging:** All activity is logged with encrypted, signed audit trails.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Automated reports for GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and HIPAA.
- **AI-Generated Legal Response:** Instantly draft breach notifications and ransomware disclosures.

### 5. Self-Healing Countermeasure Agent
- **Dynamic Policy Engine:** WASM- or Python-based rules trigger sandboxing, honeypots, route isolation, ACL mutation, or traffic shutdown on threat detection.
- **Automated Response:** All actions logged for forensic analysis and rollback.

### 🧱 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erikg713/Sentenial-X-A.I..git
cd Sentenial-X-A.I.
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Environment Configuration**

Set up your config:

```bash
cp config/example.env config/.env
```

Environment variables include:

* `LOG_LEVEL`
* `MODEL_PATH`
* `ENABLE_SIMULATOR`
* `AUTO_SHUTDOWN_ON_THREAT=true`

---

### 🚀 Running the Core Engine

Start the core semantic threat pipeline:

```bash
python core/engine/semantics_analyzer.py
```

This entry point:

* Parses traffic from `http_parser.py`
* Applies classifiers
* Triggers orchestration via `incident_reflex_manager.py`

---

### 🛡️ Running in Monitor Mode (Passive Detection)

```bash
python sentinel_main.py --mode=passive
```

* No traffic is blocked or sandboxed.
* Threats logged to `logs/threats.json`.

---

### ⚔️ Running in Defense Mode (Active Countermeasures)

```bash
python sentinel_main.py --mode=active
```

* Automatically triggers honeypots, ACLs, or session isolation.
* Writes forensic records to `logs/audit.log`.

---

### 🧪 Simulate Threat Payloads

Use the built-in fuzzer and red team model:

```bash
python core/simulator/synthetic_attack_fuzzer.py --mode=fuzz
```

* Outputs synthetic threat vectors for stress testing.

---

### 🧠 Continuous Learning Loop (Optional)

Enable model refresh via:

```bash
python core/engine/fine_tuner_adapter.py --autotune
```

* Monitors new embeddings from `malicious_embedding_analyzer.py`
* Injects adversarial samples into fine-tuning queue
