# Sentenial X A.I.

**The Ultimate Cyber Guardian — Built to Learn, Adapt, and Strike Back**  
*"Crafted for resilience. Engineered for vengeance. Sentenial X is not just a defense — it's a digital sentinel with the mind of a warrior and the reflexes of a machine."*

---

## Overview

Sentenial X A.I. is an advanced cyber defense platform engineered for modern threat landscapes. Designed to continuously learn, adapt, and respond in real time, it safeguards your digital infrastructure with state-of-the-art AI, robust compliance automation, and proactive countermeasures.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Multimodal Threat Semantics Engine
- **Contextual Understanding:** Leverages LLM-derived embeddings to analyze request intent beyond basic signatures.
- **Advanced Detection:** Trained on a diverse corpus, including threat syntax, API abuse, prompt injection, LLM jailbreaks, and blackhat tool patterns (WormGPT, DarkBERT, FraudGPT).
- **Deep Semantic Analysis:** Inspects HTTP headers, bodies, query strings, JSON payloads, and encoded/obfuscated data in real time.

### 2. Counter-Jailbreak NLP Model
- **Adversarial Detection:** Fine-tuned layers identify prompt injection, payload obfuscation (base64, hex), and LLM prompt warping.
- **Active Defense:** Rewrites, blocks, or traps jailbreak attempts automatically.
- **Continuous Learning:** Adapts to new jailbreaks with few-shot active learning.

### 3. Deep Threat Memory Core
- **Threat Intelligence Engine:** Stores anonymized threat embeddings and supports rapid online model distillation.
- **Zero-Day Adaptation:** Learns new attack patterns (e.g., malformed APIs) in near real time.
- **Custom Model Integration:** Plug in your own fine-tuned models for region-specific or org-specific intelligence.

### 4. Autonomous Legal Shield Module
- **Real-Time Logging:** All activity is logged with encrypted, signed audit trails.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Automated reports for GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and HIPAA.
- **AI-Generated Legal Response:** Instantly draft breach notifications and ransomware disclosures.

### 5. Self-Healing Countermeasure Agent
- **Dynamic Policy Engine:** WASM- or Python-based rules trigger sandboxing, honeypots, route isolation, ACL mutation, or traffic shutdown on threat detection.
- **Automated Response:** All actions logged for forensic analysis and rollback.
